lemma
  assumes T: "\<forall>x y. T x y \<or> T y x"
and A: "\<forall>x y. A x y \<and> A y x \<longrightarrow> x = y"
and TA: "\<forall> x y. T x y \<longrightarrow> A x y"
and "A x y"
shows "T x y"
proof (rule ccontr)
  assume "\<not> T x y"
  from this have "T y x" using T by blast
  from this have "A y x" using TA by blast
  from this have "x = y" using A \<open>A x y\<close> by blast
  from this have "T x y" using \<open>T y x\<close> by blast
  from this show False using \<open>\<not> T x y\<close> by blast

lemma

and A: "\<forall>x y. A x y \<and> A y x \<longrightarrow> x = y"
and TA: "\<forall> x y. T x y \<longrightarrow> A x y"
and "A x y"
shows "T x y"
proof (rule ccontr)
  assume "\<not> T x y"
  hence "T y x" using T by blast
  hence "A y x" using TA by blast
  hence "x = y" using A \<open>A x y\<close> by blast
  hence "T x y" using \<open>T y x\<close> by blast
  thus False using \<open>\<not> T x y\<close> by blast

(*
  Same argument, streamlined with Chapter 4 connectives:
  with facts = from facts this (section 4.1.1);
  ?thesis (section 4.3.1);
  classical so the last step is show ?thesis
  rather than deriving T x y and then False.

lemma
  assumes T: "\<forall>x y. T x y \<or> T y x"
and A: "\<forall>x y. A x y \<and> A y x \<longrightarrow> x = y"
and TA: "\<forall> x y. T x y \<longrightarrow> A x y"
and "A x y"
shows "T x y"
proof (rule classical)
  assume "\<not> T x y"
  with T have "T y x" by blast
  with TA have "A y x" by blast
  with A \<open>A x y\<close> have "x = y" by blast
  with \<open>T y x\<close> show ?thesis by blast
